# Meme Me

## Description
Refactor and integration of Udacity's Swift Nanodegree "MemeMe" and ["MemeMe 2.0"](https://github.com/andrebocato/MemeMe2.0.git) projects. 

## Objectives
* Integrate two similar Nanodegree projects I've done into one, rewritting old code while using new techniques.
* Test a MVC architecture implementation.

## Persistence
* App data is persisted through [Realm](https://realm.io) and you need [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) to use it.
* Useful information on how to set up those features can be found at the provided links.

## Needs fixing
* Top and bottom text fields placeholder texts are too transparent.

## TODOs
* Properly add and fix icons.
* Implement Haptic Feedback.
* Implement loading views on Fetching actions.
* Implement long gesture recognizers.
* Implement deletion buttons.
* Figure out a way to display text edition.
* Merge uncommited changes.
