# Meme Me

## Description
Refactor and integration of Udacity's Swift Nanodegree "MemeMe" and "MemeMe 2.0" projects.

## Objectives
Integrate two similar Nanodegree projects I've done into one, rewritting old code using new techniques.

## Needs fixing
* The ImageView on the Detal View shows a white bar on the top.
* Top and bottom text fields are not properly centered and placeholder text is too transparent.

## TODOs
* Properly add and fix icons.
* Implement a "select image quality for exporting"-like feature.
* Implement Haptic Feedback.
* Implement loading views on Fetching actions.
* Implement long gesture recognizers.
