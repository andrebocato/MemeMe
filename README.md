# Meme Me

## Description

Refactor and integration of Udacity's Swift Nanodegree "MemeMe" and "MemeMe 2.0" projects.

## Objectives
Integrate two similar Nanodegree projects I've done into one, rewritting old code using new techniques and a MVC architecture.

## Known bugs
Fortunately none up to this moment.

## TODOs

* Implement persistence layer using [Realm](https://realm.io/).
* Integrate [MemeMe 2.0](https://github.com/andrebocato/MemeMe2.0) features.
* Implement networking layer.
* Implement a random image generator using the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
* Properly add and fix icons.
