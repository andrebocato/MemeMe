# Meme Me

## Description
Refactor and integration of Udacity's Swift Nanodegree "MemeMe" and "MemeMe 2.0" projects.

## Objectives
Integrate two similar Nanodegree projects I've done into one, rewritting old code using new techniques.

## Known bugs
* The method used in printing the screen (and saving the memed image) is not working as expected. A white bar is generated over the image.

## TODOs
* Implement persistence layer using [Realm](https://realm.io/).
* Integrate [MemeMe 2.0](https://github.com/andrebocato/MemeMe2.0) features.
* Implement networking layer.
* Implement a random image generator using the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
* Properly add and fix icons.
